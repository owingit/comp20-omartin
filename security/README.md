##README for Comp 20 Assignment 4
##Owen Martin

1. I included all necessary components of the security report and found two 
   significant security flaws with my partner's web application, but I could
   not find a third.
2. I didn't collaborate with anybody, but I borrowed some styling ideas from
   the example you provided of Gabe's report.
3. I spent all day Friday (4/24) on the assignment - it was a lot of fun to
   sit in a cafe and think of interesting ways to mess up a website.

4. I feel bad because now Maggie's app just has a big picture of a "fail
   whale" instead of a lovely list of logins. Oops.
