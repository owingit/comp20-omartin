README for Ms. Pacman Lab
Owen Martin


1. I correctly implemented the javascript drawImage procedure and have Ms. 
   Pacman happily in her Pacman maze ready to have a lot of fun.
2. I didn't collaborate with anybody.
3. I spent about 2-3 hours reading javascript documentation and then about an 
   hour implementing my solution
   Cheers
