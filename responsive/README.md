#README for Lab 4

1. I correctly implemented all aspects of the lab except that which restricts
   the image size to 130x240 px. I tinkered with tons of different CS stylings
   but everything I tried was ineffective, so I'm submitting just a responsive
   comic that starts out whole and decreases by one panel each time.
2. I didn't collab with anybody.
3. I spent a couple hours each day for about 3 days on this assignment
